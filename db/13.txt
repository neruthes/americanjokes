President Trump was visiting a hospital which lacked medical supplies for epidemic control, with CDC an officer accompanying.

They moved by a room and President Trump found a mask on the ground.

"Whose mask is this?" President Trump asked with a dim anger.

The CDC officer looked around and replied excitedly. "Not anyone, seemingly. Hurry, get it as yours, President!"
