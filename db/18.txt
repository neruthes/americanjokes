Since CDC declared that masks were in shortage, people had to wait in long queues in front of specific stores to buy some.

A red-nose guy from Texas ran out of his patience and watched the new announcement from CDC. "Ordinary people do not need to wear masks; washing hands frequently is enough to defend Covid-19..."

"Oh my God. I gonna shoot their boss." The guy turned away.

A few moments later, he came back. "You shot him?"

"Damn it! The queue over there is longer than this one!"
