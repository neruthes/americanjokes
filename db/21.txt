An American man wanted to buy masks and was required to queue for it. The clerk at CVS gave him a number card. "Welcome sir. You can pick your masks on the same day of ten years later."

"No problem. I just want to know, is it the morning or the afternoon?"

The clerk look at him strangely. "Ten years later. Does it matter if it is the morning or the afternoon?"

"Sure! I queued to buy toilet paper at Walmart; the morning in this day of ten years later."
