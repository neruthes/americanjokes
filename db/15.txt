Secret service agents of various counties wanted to figure out which country was the most power. They got a mission that there was a Covid-19 confirmed case and they are wanted to find out his close contacts.

One hour later, the Chinese agents came back with a list. "Through big data investigations over transit, phone, hotel, and others, we have located 95% close contacts and they are now all quarantined."

"Good. 95 points."

Two hours later, the South Korean agents came back. "Despite cult idiots, we managed to find most close contacts and have quarantined them."

"Not too late. 70 points."

They waited and waited. When the sun set, the American agents finally came back. Four agents were grabbing the poor patient who was constantly coughing, and the agent was beating and threatening him. "Now confess that you only got flu."
